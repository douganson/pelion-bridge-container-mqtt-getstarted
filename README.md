Container Bridge Instance Installation:

1). Clone this repo into a Linux instance that supports docker

2). cd into the cloned repo and run: ./run-reload-bridge.sh

3). Next go to https://os.mbed.com and create your mbed Account. You can then request a Pelion developer account using the same credentials at https://portal.us-east-1.mbedcloud.com

4). Once your Pelion account is created, you need to "Access Keys" to create a Pelion API Key/Token. Record the Token Value

Now that you have your:

    - MQTT Broker IP Address 

    - Pelion API Key/Token generated

Go to:  https://[[your containers public IP address]]:8234

    - username: "admin" (no quotes)

    - password: "admin" (no quotes)

Enter your MQTT Broker IP address and Pelion API Token

    - Please press "SAVE" after *each* is entered... 

    - After all are entered and saved, press "RESTART"

Your Generic MQTT bridge should now be configured and operational. 

NOTE: for the test scripts, I've had issues with paho-mqtt v1.2. Try v1.1... seems to work better.
